# Pygame demo

## Goal:

- Create a planet rotation simulation

## Future features:

- Pulling data on actual rotation of planets, if available and implement.

## Running this repository:

### User needs to have pygame installed, if pygame is not installed, consider following:

1. User needs to create a virtual environment first. As we want to install pygame within a contained environment. While your desired IDE is opened to the repo:

   - In your terminal, type the following: `python -m venv NAMEOFYOURVENV` or `python3 -m venv NAMEOFYOURVENV`

2. Once user has created a virtual environment, run `source NAMEOFYOURVENV/bin/activate` in order to access the virtual environment.

   - User will know they are in the venv when it has the folder name in parenthesis in the front of the CLI

3. User can now run the line `pip install pygame`

4. While still in the virtual environment, run `python main.py` to run the repo.
